# MultiMusik
Play Music on many different devices at once. MultiMusik sends audio packets through sockets to any amount of devices - A cheap and effective Home Audio Solution for the masses.



# TESTING NEEDED
- Testing from Windows -> Raspberry Pi (Debian) is a crucial part of the concept of MultiMusik, and the completion of testing in this area will validate this project idea and allow further development on more features to occur.


## Current progress:
- File transfer from server to client succesfully works with a tested 1 client. More testing will come soon, however the project has already been designed around support for multiple devices. For testing purposes, "best.mp3", which is found in resources, can be used.
